Motivation
Have you ever wondered how to translate the paths of pages created by page manager, for example?
Let's suppose we have a scenario with a multilingual website and we create our events/!city page in English using page manager and now we need to translate the path to portuguese.
Now it's possible to create those paths by going to admin/config/regional/i18n_translation/path and using * as wildcards.
You simply have to add events/* on the English version and add eventos/* on the Portuguese, for example!

Configuration
The module is plug and play, so you don't need to configure anything.
